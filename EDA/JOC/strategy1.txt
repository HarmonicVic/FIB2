PLAN:    fighting for 1st 50% of game, then full flee and recover money, fight otherwise

WHAT DO I WANT TO DO DURING THE DAY:
    BOTH:
    -if touching cell is money, take it

    BUILDERS:
    -builder builds barricades 
    -if barricade built to lvl 2, look for money
    -if builder HP < 50%, start taking food, otherwise ignore
    -builder also works as search for weapons, if builder finds weapon, tells warriors

    WARRIORS:
    -search for weapons with warriors, if hp != full, take food if in touching cell
    -if warrior HP < 60%, start looking for food
    -if warrior finds better weapon, takes it, if weapon <= warrior, warrior tells other warriors about weapon pos and id


WHAT DO I WANT TO DO DURING THE NIGHT:
    BOTH:
    -if touching cell is money, take it 

    BUILDERS:
    -builder protects himself during night with barricades if chased
    -if not chased, look for money

    WARRIORS:
    -warriors look for other players
    -if touching cell is player && weapon > hammer, attack
    -if HP < 30%, search for food, don't attack, flee away from enemies


BEFORE 50% OF ROUNDS:
    -prioritize searching for weapons 
    -fight if weapon >= gun
    -take money if found


AFTER 50% OF ROUNDS:
    -prioritize survival (30% threshold, flee if necessary)
    -fight if weapon == bazooka
    -search for money
